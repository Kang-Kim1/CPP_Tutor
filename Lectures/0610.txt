- C++?
  => Also OO language based on C
  => Many syntax are similar as C 
 (which means we will learn C as well..)
  => file extension? -> .cpp
  => linux command for c++ : g++ / for Java : javac

- main function 
  => difference between Java main method?
  => return ? 0 = success, 1 = failure

- include<header_file>
  => same as import statement in Java
  => header_file : file containing declarations and macro definition to be shared between several source files
     (like class)
  => iostream.h(in lib)
     * standard input/output stream
     * cout, endl, printf, ...  
  => print out to console
     * cout 
     * << / >> : into / out from
     * printf 
     * next line : endl, \n

- using namespace namespace_name
  => specific space with a name
  => std : is the namespace defined in iostream
  => would std still compilable without any header-file? Yes, because std is implicitly defined
  => without namespace declaration : std::sth
  => easier way to understand this concept
     * 2 header files with same name of function
     * do you have to change the name for one of functions? yes, in C
     * in C++, namespaece is the solution to figure this problem

practice : 
  Let's print out with using cout with multiple << statements
