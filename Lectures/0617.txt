- Comment (same as Java)

- Standard C++ input : cin 

- Loops
  ㄴ For
  ㄴ While

- Conditional
  ㄴ Switch
  ㄴ If

- casting 
  ㄴ int => float/double : (float)/(double)
  ㄴ float/double => int : (int)
  ㄴ string => int : stoi()
  ㄴ int => string : to_string()

* practice *
Code a simple program called "Guess my number"
- You have fixed number
- User enter a number to guess your number
  ㄴ If user finds your number, then ask user name and finally print "[username]!, you got my number! => [your number]"
  ㄴ If user entered wrong number, then print "Sorry, try again!", and give user another chance
  ㄴ Print a hint message if user input is  [your number] - 5 <= [user input] => [your number] + 5
  ㄴ If input is -1 then exit
- User have only five chances
- Secret code 8989 increases number of chance 

- Pointer(★★★★★★)
  ㄴ varialbe to store the memory address 
     * with memory address we can : easily, quickly access into data, manage address, ... 
     * efficient for data structure 
     * pointer itself has a fixed size
  ㄴ Most important concept of C
  ㄴ put * after datae type makes as a pointer (ex. int* a;)
  ㄴ & in front of variable returns the reference whici is the address of the first memory block
  ㄴ difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference
